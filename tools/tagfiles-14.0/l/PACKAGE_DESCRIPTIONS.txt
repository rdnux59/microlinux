poppler: Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC.  Since xpdf does not provide a shared
poppler: library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications
poppler: incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched.  By providing
poppler: a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.

popt: popt (command line parsing library)
popt:
popt: Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters.  Popt was
popt: heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but it
popt: improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion.  Popt
popt: can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set
popt: variables based on command line arguments.  Popt allows command line
popt: arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes utility
popt: functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
popt: shell-like rules.
