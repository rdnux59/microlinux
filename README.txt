*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

The Microlinux Software Repository is currently undergoing a major overhaul,
for several reasons:

  1. Avoid duplication.

  2. Allow more flexibility and easy maintenance.

  3. Allow a more desktop-agnostic use.

  4. Strive for full compatibility with other third-party projects like MateSlackBuild.

Everything will be restored as fast as possible. 

In the meantime, sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
