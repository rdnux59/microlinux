PyKDE4 complains about a missing PolkitQt package : 

  -- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been found:

   * PolkitQt , Qt wrapper around Polkit
     Required to build Python Polkit bindings

According to the BLFS mailing list, this warning can be ignored, as the
corresponding version is deprecated, and nothing ever uses it anyway.
