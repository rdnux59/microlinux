libisoburn: libisoburn (frontend for libburn and libisofs)
libisoburn:
libisoburn: libisoburn is a frontend for libraries libburn and libisofs which
libisoburn: enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all
libisoburn: CD/DVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW,
libisoburn: which do not support multi-session management on media level and even
libisoburn: plain disk files or block devices. The price for that is thorough
libisoburn: specialization on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images.
