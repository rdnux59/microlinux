gc: gc (Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector)
gc:
gc: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used
gc: as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It
gc: allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would,
gc: without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The
gc: collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it
gc: can no longer be otherwise accessed.
